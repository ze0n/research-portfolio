            <i><b>Abstract:</b></i> One of the most important issues in Decision Support Systems (DSS) technology is in
            ensuring their
            effectiveness and efficiency for future implementations and use. DSS is prominent tool in disaster
            information system, which allows the authority to provide life safety information directly to the mobile
            devices of anyone physically located in the evacuation area. After that a personal DSS guides users to
            a safe point. Due to the large uncertainty in initial conditions and assumptions on underlying process
            the implementation and evaluation of such DSS are extremely hard, particularly in real environment.
            We propose a simulation methodology for the evaluation of in-vehicle DSS for emergency evacuation
            based on transport system and human decision-making modeling.</p>

agents, (b) the relative evacuation time for each scenario</span>
            <img src="img/traffic/graphs.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p><b>The key finding</b> is
            that the significant effect can be achieved on existing infrastructure without drastic modifications. The
            overall effectiveness of the evacuation depends on the fraction of DSS users in a total evacuee
            number. For our case study the best time of evacuation was reached at 80%-85% (12.5 – 50 thousands
            of agent) of DSS users and it is approximately two times faster than without the use of DSS at all.
            Before optimum the rate of evacuation time falls linearly. After that, the efficiency of evacuation
            started to decline and other routing algorithms dealing with traffic flow rather than with individual
            users are required.</p>

            <i><b>Abstract:</b></i> Development of personal decision support systems for emergency evacuation is a

            on the base of an agent-based simulation framework. The application is composed of a
            traffic dynamics model coupled to a flood model and is used as a framework for
            investigation of the efficiency of three in-vehicle spatial personal decision support
            systems. These navigation systems are based on different approaches to the
            management of environmental dynamics information.

            <i><b>Abstract:</b></i>
            Effective treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients depends on the transportation time to a
            hospital. But selection of an optimal route and target hospital for an ambulance within a large city is a
            complex problem. It requires taking into account the dynamical nature of an urban environment. Such
            dynamic factors as traffic flow, changing road graph, population mobility, and hospital capabilities are
            sources of uncertainty in decision making on hospitalization, and eventually they influence the
            functioning quality of emergency medical services (EMS) in a city. This work is devoted to the analysis
            of this problem for the city of Saint-Petersburg (Russia) with the use of statistical data, public
            geographic information services (OpenStreetMap), and real-time data on traffic flow (Yandex.Maps).
            It is shown that dynamic traffic conditions influence selection of a hospital and have to be considered
            within the task of ambulance routing. The results may be applied in order to design a more efficient
            EMS decision support system for ambulance personnel and dispatchers.

        Workflow Scheduling Algorithm for Dynamic Heterogeneous Distributed Computational Environment. In International
        Joint Conference SOCO’14-CISIS’14-ICEUTE’14 (pp. 83-92). Springer International Publishing.</span>
            <i><b>Abstract:</b></i>
            The optimal workflow scheduling is one of the most important issues
            in heterogeneous distributed computational environment. Existing heuristic and
            evolutionary scheduling algorithms have their advantages and disadvantages. In
            this work we propose a hybrid algorithm based on Heterogeneous Earliest
            Finish Time heuristic and genetic algorithm that combines best characteristics
            of both approaches. We also experimentally show its efficiency for variable
            workload in dynamically changing heterogeneous computational environment.

            <i><b>Abstract:</b></i>
            In this work the framework for detectors layout optimization based on a multi-agent simulation is
            proposed. Its main intention is to provide a decision support team with a tool for automatic design of
            social threat detection systems for public crowded places. Containing a number of distributed
            detectors, this system performs detection and an identification of threat carriers. The generic model of
            detector used in the framework allows to consider detection of various types of threats, e.g. infections,
            explosives, drugs, radiation. The underlying agent-based models provide data on social mobility,
            which is used along with a probability based quality assessment model within the optimization
            process. The implemented multi-criteria optimization scheme is based on a genetic algorithm. For
            experimental study the framework has been applied in order to get the optimal detectors' layout in
            Pulkovo airport.

            <i><b>Abstract:</b></i>
            Currently social networks are a medium designed to share and spread information and opinions
            among users. To effectively spread information characteristics of information sources and their
            positions in the network have to be properly adjusted. Sources play a crucial role as they initiate and
            support the spreading process. Adjusting sources has a certain cost and thus their non-optimal
            configuration may lead to wasting resources spent to sources adjusting or even poor performance. In
            this work, the problem of sources settings and positions optimization is discussed and the framework
            for solving the problem is proposed. The developed framework incorporates source and spreading
            models which take into account individual characteristics of sources as characteristics of their
            positions. The solution can handle all steps which may be required for optimization: network
            monitoring and data collecting; parameters and settings identification; source layout optimization.
            The efficiency of solutions generated by the framework with the genetic algorithm adapted for source
            layout optimization is demonstrated by comparison with greedy heuristic on the dataset collected
            from Twitter.
